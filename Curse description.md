# ChatLink-1.0
A framework for World of Warcraft addons to provide clickable chat links.

This library provides tools that let you create a chat link, then react to it when the user clicks the link.

## Sample use cases
1) An addon alerts the user to an issue by adding a line to the chat. The user can click a chat link to open a window (addon frame) with more information.

2) An addon identifies a rare and puts its location in the zone general chat. Any user who also has the addon installed should be able to click the chat link to add a waypoint arrow to Tomtom (or similar).

3) A roleplaying/storytelling addon allows a group of players to create a branching text system. The "GM" pre-populates a set of story segments and responses. Each segment has key words highlighted, and when other players indicate interest in the key words, the appropriate response is given (optionally with more key words). Other players in the group can click the chat text to "respond" and hear the next segment of the story.

## Usage:
For full usage details, see the documentation in the main file, or check the [Github repo](https://github.com/KyrosKrane/ChatLink).

## Version Notes
V0.01-alpha is a developer preview. The core functionality is enabled, but debugging output is still turned on, which makes it unsuitable for general use. In addition, public/private links are not implemented; all links are private.

## Known errors
Still in early alpha, so expect odd behavior. The core functionality should work, though.
